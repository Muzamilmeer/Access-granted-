# Setting Up ShopEase on GitHub

Follow these steps to push your ShopEase shopping app to GitHub:

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites
- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your machine
- The ShopEase project files (which you already have!)

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step GitHub Setup

### 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name your repository (e.g., "shopease-shopping-app")
5. Add a description: "Modern React shopping app with TypeScript"
6. Keep it public or private (your choice)
7. **DON'T** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
8. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Connect Your Local Project to GitHub
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd shopping-app

# Add your GitHub repository as the remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Rename the main branch to 'main' (GitHub standard)
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify Upload
1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your project files
3. The README.md will display automatically

## ðŸŽ¯ Example Commands
Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual values:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/shopease-shopping-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## ðŸ”§ Future Updates
After the initial setup, you can push updates with:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```

## ðŸ“± GitHub Pages Deployment (Optional)
To deploy your app on GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Scroll to "Pages" section
3. Select source: "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose "gh-pages" branch (after setting up deployment)

Or use the build command:
```bash
npm run build
# Then deploy the build folder to GitHub Pages
```

## ðŸŽ‰ You're All Set!
Once pushed to GitHub, you can:
- Share your project with others
- Collaborate with team members
- Set up automated deployments
- Show off your awesome shopping app!
